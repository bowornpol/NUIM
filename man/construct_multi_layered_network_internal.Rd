Microbe-Pathway network file.}

\item{pathway_jaccard_file}{A character string specifying the path to the
Pathway-Pathway Jaccard index file.}

\item{pathway_metabolite_file}{A character string specifying the path to the
Pathway-Metabolite network file.}

\item{output_directory}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
where the final integrated multi-layered network CSV file will be saved.}

\value{
A character string representing the path to the generated multi-layered network CSV file.

\description{
This function integrates various network layers (Microbe-Pathway, Pathway-Pathway,
and Pathway-Metabolite) into a single comprehensive network. It uses GSEA
results as a central filter to ensure that only relevant pathways and their
associated connections are included in the final integrated network. This is
an internal function primarily used by `construct_multi_layered_network_full`
and wrapped by `construct_multi_layered_network`.
