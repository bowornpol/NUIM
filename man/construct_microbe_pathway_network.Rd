\usage{
construct_microbe_pathway_network(
  contrib_file,
  metadata_file,
  taxonomy_file,
  output_file,
  file_type = c("csv", "tsv"),
  filtering = c("unfiltered", "mean", "median", "top10\%", "top25\%", "top50\%",
    "top75\%")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{contrib_file}{A character string specifying the path to the contribution data file.
Expected columns include 'SampleID', 'FeatureID', 'FunctionID', and 'taxon_function_abun'.}

\item{metadata_file}{A character string specifying the path to the sample metadata file.
Expected columns include 'SampleID' and optionally 'class'.}

\item{taxonomy_file}{A character string specifying the path to the taxonomy data file.
Expected columns include 'FeatureID' and 'TaxonID'.}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
where the output CSV files will be saved. The directory will be created
if it does not exist.}

\item{file_type}{A character string indicating the type of input files.
Must be "csv" (for comma-separated) or "tsv" (for tab-separated).}

\item{filtering}{A character string specifying the filtering method to apply.
Must be one of "unfiltered", "mean", "median", "top10%", "top25%", "top50%",
or "top75%". "unfiltered" means no filtering is applied.}
}
\value{
The functionâ€™s primary output is CSV files saved to the specified \code{output_file} directory, one for each unique class.
}
\description{
#' This function processes microbial contribution, metadata, and taxonomy data
to construct a microbe-pathway network, calculating relative contributions
of taxa to specific functions. It supports various filtering options
to focus on the most significant contributions.
}
\details{
The function performs several key steps:
1. Loads input CSV/TSV files (contribution, metadata, taxonomy).
2. Handles missing 'class' column in metadata by assigning a default 'all' class.
3. Merges the datasets based on SampleID and FeatureID.
4. Aggregates taxon-function abundance per class.
5. Calculates the relative contribution of each taxon to a function.
6. Applies optional filtering (mean, median, top percentages) based on
   relative contribution.
7. Saves the processed network data as a CSV file for each class.
