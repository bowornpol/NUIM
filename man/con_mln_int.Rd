\description{
This function integrates various network layers (Microbe-Pathway, Pathway-Pathway,
and Pathway-Metabolite) into a single comprehensive network. It uses GSEA
results as a central filter to ensure that only relevant pathways and their
associated connections are included in the final integrated network. This is
an internal function primarily used by `con_mln_all`
and wrapped by `con_mln`.
