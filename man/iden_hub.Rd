\title{Hub identification using Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm}
\usage{
iden_hub(
  multi_layered_network_file,
  output_directory,
  file_type = c("csv", "tsv"),
  top_n_hubs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multi_layered_network_file}{A character string specifying the path to the
integrated multi-layered network data file (output
from `con.mln` or `con.mln.all`). Expected columns: 'Feature1' and
'Feature2'. 'edge_score' and 'edge_type' are loaded but not directly used
in the MCC calculation itself (only edge presence matters for cliques).}

\item{output_directory}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
where the hub identification results will be saved as a CSV file.
The directory will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{file_type}{A character string indicating the type of input file.
Must be "csv" (for comma-separated) or "tsv" (for tab-separated).}

\item{top_n_hubs}{An optional integer specifying the number of top hub nodes
to return. If `NULL` (default), all nodes will be returned, ranked by MCC score.}
}
\value{
The function's primary output is a CSV file saved
   to the specified `output_directory`, containing the ranked list of nodes
   and their MCC scores.
}
\description{
This function identifies hub nodes in a multi-layered network using the
Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Loads the integrated multi-layered network from the specified CSV/TSV file.
2. Constructs an undirected `igraph` object from the network data.
3. Finds all maximal cliques within the graph.
4. Calculates the MCC score for each node:
   - It sums `factorial(clique_size - 1)` for each maximal clique of size
     3 or more that contains the node.
   - After this summation, if a node's calculated MCC score is still zero
     (meaning it wasn't part of any clique of size >= 3) AND it has a
     degree greater than zero, its MCC is then set to its degree.
5. Ranks nodes by their MCC score in descending order.
6. Optionally filters to return only the top N hub nodes.
7. Saves the ranked hub identification results to a CSV file.
