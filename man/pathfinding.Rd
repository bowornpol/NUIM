\usage{
pathfinding(
  multi_layered_network_file,
  source_node,
  target_node,
  output_directory
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multi_layered_network_file}{A character string specifying the path to the
CSV file containing the integrated multi-layered network data (e.g., output
from `construct_multi_layered_network`). Expected columns: 'Feature1',
'Feature2', 'Edge_Score' (numeric), and 'Edge_Type'.}

\item{source_node}{A character string specifying the name of the starting node
for pathfinding. This node must exist in the network.}

\item{target_node}{A character string specifying the name of the ending node
for pathfinding. This node must exist in the network.}

\item{output_directory}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
where the shortest path results will be saved as a CSV file. The directory
will be created if it does not exist.}
}
\value{
The function's primary output is a CSV file saved
  to the specified `output_directory`, detailing the edges of the shortest path
  found between the source and target nodes. If no path is found, `NULL` is returned
  invisibly and a message is printed.
}
\description{
This function identifies the shortest path between a specified source node
and a target node within an integrated multi-layered network. It constructs
an `igraph` object from the network data and uses Dijkstra's algorithm
with transformed edge weights to find the optimal path.
}
\details{
The edge weights are transformed from `Edge_Score` as follows:
- If `Edge_Score` is `NA`, weight is `Inf`.
- If `Edge_Score` is less than 1, weight is `1 / Edge_Score`.
- If `Edge_Score` is exactly 1, weight is `1 / (Edge_Score + 0.1)` to avoid `1/1=1` which might not be ideal for shortest path.
- If `Edge_Score` is greater than 1, weight is `Edge_Score`.
This transformation aims to represent stronger connections (higher `Edge_Score`)
as shorter paths (lower weights).
