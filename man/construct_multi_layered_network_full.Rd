\description{
This comprehensive function orchestrates the construction of all individual
network layers (Microbe-Pathway, Pathway-Pathway, Pathway-Metabolite) and
then integrates them into a single, cohesive multi-layered network. It
combines the functionality of `construct_microbe_pathway_network`,
`construct_pathway_pathway_network`, `construct_pathway_metabolite_network`,
and `construct_multi_layered_network` into one convenient, end-to-end call.
}
\details{
The pipeline executes in the following sequential order to respect data dependencies:
1.  **Pathway-Pathway Network Construction (`construct_pathway_pathway_network`):**
    Performs differential expression analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
    to identify enriched pathways and subsequently computes Jaccard indices
    to quantify overlap between core enrichment genes of significant pathways.
    (This step must run first as its GSEA results are a dependency for other layers).
2.  **Microbe-Pathway Network Construction (`construct_microbe_pathway_network`):**
    Calculates the relative contributions of microbial taxa to specific functions.
3.  **Pathway-Metabolite Network Construction (`construct_pathway_metabolite_network`):**
    Computes correlations between pathway abundances and metabolite concentrations,
    optionally filtering results based on GSEA findings and statistical significance.
4.  **Multi-Layered Network Integration (`construct_multi_layered_network`):**
    Combines the outputs from the previous three steps into a single, integrated
    network, filtering based on the GSEA results from Step 1.

All intermediate and final output files are saved within organized subdirectories
of the specified `base_output_directory`.
