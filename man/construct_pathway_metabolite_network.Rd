\arguments{
\item{pathway_abundance_file}{A character string specifying the path to the
pathway abundance data file. Expected: Pathways as rows,
samples as columns, with the first column being pathway IDs.}

\item{metabolite_concentration_file}{A character string specifying the path
to the metabolite concentration data file. Expected: Samples
as rows, metabolites as columns, with the first column being sample IDs.}

\item{gsea_results_file}{An optional character string specifying the path
to a GSEA results file (e.g., from `construct_pathway_pathway_network`).
If provided, pathways will be filtered to those present in this file, and
the filename might influence group processing. Set to `NULL` if not used.}

\item{metadata_file}{An optional character string specifying the path to the
sample metadata file. Must include 'SampleID' and 'class'
columns if provided. If `NULL`, all samples are treated as a single 'overall' group.}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the path to the directory
where the output CSV files (correlation results) will be saved.
The directory will be created if it does not exist.}

\item{file_type}{A character string indicating the type of input files.
Must be "csv" (for comma-separated) or "tsv" (for tab-separated).}

\item{correlation_method}{A character string specifying the correlation method.
Must be "spearman" or "pearson".}

\item{filter_by}{A character string specifying how to filter the correlation
results. Must be "none", "p_value", or "q_value".}

\item{corr_cutoff}{A numeric value specifying the absolute correlation
coefficient cutoff. Only correlations with an absolute value greater than
or equal to this cutoff will be kept.}

\item{p_value_cutoff}{A numeric value specifying the p-value cutoff. Required
if `filter_by` is "p_value".}

\item{q_value_cutoff}{A numeric value specifying the q-value (adjusted p-value)
cutoff. Required if `filter_by` is "q_value".}

\item{q_adjust_method}{A character string specifying the method for q-value
(p-value) adjustment. Must be "bonferroni" or "fdr" (False Discovery Rate).
Used if `filter_by` is "q_value".}

\value{
Invisible \code{NULL}. The function's primary output is CSV files saved to the specified \code{output_file} directory, containing the filtered pathway-metabolite correlation results for each processed group.

\description{
This function calculates correlations between pathway abundances and metabolite
concentrations, optionally filtering results based on GSEA findings and
statistical significance. It supports both Spearman and Pearson correlation
methods and various p-value/q-value adjustment options.
}
\details{
The function performs the following key steps:
1.  **Loads Input Data:** Reads pathway abundance, metabolite concentration, and optional metadata files (CSV or TSV).
2.  **Handles Sample Grouping:** If a `metadata_file` is provided, it groups samples based on the 'class' column. Otherwise, all samples are treated as a single 'overall' group.
3.  **Applies GSEA Filtering (Optional):** If a `gsea_results_file` is provided, it identifies significant pathways from the GSEA results and filters both pathway abundance and metabolite concentration data to include only samples and pathways relevant to these significant findings.
4.  **Calculates Correlations:** Computes pairwise correlations between pathway abundances and metabolite concentrations using the specified `correlation_method` (Spearman or Pearson) for each identified sample group.
5.  **Applies Statistical Filtering:** Adjusts p-values (if `filter_by` is "q_value") and filters correlation results based on the `corr_cutoff`, `p_value_cutoff`, and/or `q_value_cutoff`.
6.  **Derives Edge Attributes:** For the filtered correlations, it generates `Edge_Score` (based on the absolute correlation coefficient) and `Edge_Type` (indicating positive or negative correlation).
7.  **Saves Results:** Stores the processed and filtered pathway-metabolite correlation data frames as CSV files in the specified `output_file` directory, with filenames reflecting the correlation method, cutoffs, and relevant GSEA comparison (if applicable).
